# Tooling

## Infrastructure as Code

### Docker

### Kubernetes

## Security

### Talisman
https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman

Talisman is a tool that installs a hook to your repository to ensure that potential secrets or sensitive information do not leave the developer's workstation.

It validates the outgoing changeset for things that look suspicious - such as potential SSH keys, authorization tokens, private keys etc.
